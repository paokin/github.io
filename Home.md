SBTech has an industry-leading sports betting offer covering more than 55 sports, with 20,000+ events offered for in-play betting per month. Along with providing fully or semi-managed solutions, we ensure our operators have a high degree of control over the trading parameters, including unique pricing and operator level risk management.

The pages in this wiki are intended to provide information on the specifics of the Sports Data API. Site operators and developers will gain a perspective of how to utilise it to build a full end-user facing sports application using SBTech as their sports betting provider. More specifically, we will focus on: 

* How to setup and authenticate to start developing and running applications
* How to build queries and subscribe for updates
* How to read the response payload
* How to interpret the structure of the entities and their parameters
